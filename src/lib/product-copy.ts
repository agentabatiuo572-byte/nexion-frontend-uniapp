// Localized per-SKU marketing copy.
//
// src/mock/products.ts owns the backend-replaceable data shape and the English
// source strings; the display layer resolves the active locale here so store
// cards / detail / search never render raw mock English. Product `name`
// (NexGridBox S1, Cloud Share …) is a brand mark and is deliberately NOT
// translated — only prose fields are.
//
// Falls back to the products.ts English when a SKU has no catalog entry, so a
// newly added product degrades to English instead of crashing. verify.sh
// asserts id parity so that fallback stays unreachable in practice.
