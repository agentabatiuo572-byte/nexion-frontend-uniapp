/**
 * Events Center mock — ported from Nexion-prototype/lib/mock/events.ts.
 *
 * Promotions, contests, lucky-wheels, regional PK. MOCK-ONLY; production:
 * GET /api/events + per-user join/claim overlay. tint hex are the source's
 * literal per-event accent palette (data values used at runtime in color-mix
 * / gradients), never substituting v5 surface/text tokens.
 *
 * `trackable` events (those whose progress is user-driven) opt into the
 * event-quest store's join/claim flow; decorative/auto events keep their
 * hardcoded `joined` flag. The source's separate evaluateEventProgress()
 * evaluator is inlined here as the `trackable` flag + a fixed reward map,
 * keeping the page self-contained without porting the live-progress context.
